                <p>
                    The context of use for both the university bus station and the application we designed is going to school/ the faculty by taking the bus or the tram.

                    Main Audience</h3>
                <p>
                    The main audience consists primarily of students that live in Iasi, take the bus in order to get to university and have access to the stations linked to Campus.

                    <p>
                       In spite of the fact that the station is quite large, there are not enough signs that indicate its location; for a new student, it is very easy to miss the way to the station because of the lack of indicators.

                    <p>There are a lot of buses and trams that go through the same route and there is no indication made in order to help the people decide on which transportation device to take.</p>
                    <p>When buying a ticket, there are a lot of options and no kind of recommendation on which would fit someone best, according to the number of travels they need to perform.</p>

                    <p>All the actions that someone may perform in this area are straight-forward: when one decides which ticket they need to buy, the steps so not imply anything.</p>

                    Metaphors/ Idioms</h3>
                <p>One way metaphors are already used is by having the tram/ bus icon beside its number on the monitor, letting people know which kind of transportation device is coming. However, at this point, there is no way to know if an upcoming tram has a special place and platform for a wheelchair, especially in the case of trams: the newer versions are suited for wheelchair travellers, while the older versions are impossible to take; therefore, on the screen that shows the number of buses/trams that are coming, there may be an icon showing whether it is wheelchair-friendly.</p>

                    <span>1.5</span>
                    Affordances</h3>
                <p>Inside trams/ buses, there are clear explanation on the windows about how to use the current ticket app. However, when buying a ticket in the bus/ tram, the ticket machine has no explanation about how to use it; there should be placed some posters with information about how to select the ticket you want (the button “start” isn’t suggestive enough for changing the ticket type, while “stop” doesn’t imply that you’ve reached the desired type); it should also say when the ticket is done printing and can be pulled out, as lots of people keep pulling while it is still printing.</p>

                    <span>1.6</span>
                    Visual Variables</h3>
                <p>One of the biggest downfalls at the station is the fact that it is impossible to read, from the other end of the station, the monitor displaying the transportation devices and the time till they arrive. On the monitor, both trams and buses are written in white; it would be more helpful to have different colours for the two different devices, making it easier for people to recognize them even from far away. Another idea would be to have different colours for the time left until the device arrives, for example intervals 1-5 minutes would be red, while 6-10 would be blue. In addition to the colours, the font needs to increase in size.</p>

                    Improvements</h3>
                <p>This are just a few improvements we think would improve the whome experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>On the monitor, there should be an indicator of how full the tram/bus is and whether the wheelchair space is occupied.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Beside the ticket machine, there should be a poster of statistics about the tickets and their prices, like one-week ticket would be more cost-effective than buying 6 tickets.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The station needs to be mark better. Therefore, there would be very useful to have more signs pointing to the station such that it is harder to miss for new students.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Late in the evening or early in the night, there is no way to know what buses/ trams are still going. It would be very helpful, for people that need to get home very late, to have a way to indicate a list of devices that would still pass through the station, even if it would take more than 15 minutes to get there (15 minutes is usually the maximum time displayed on the monitor).</p></li>

                <p>We proposed a new app, created in order to smooth the experience of finding a transportation device and buying tickets. In our vision, it would be much easier to travel throughout the city, especially for people with walking disabilities that need to use a wheelchair</p>
                <p>The context of use is primarily going to school or faculty by taking the bus or the tram.</p>
                <p>The main audience the app targets consists in students from or that live in Iasi.</p>

                <p>For all the icons in the app, we used metaphors (the “home” icon for the “Home” page, the “magnifying glass” for “Search”) and idioms (“” for “Settings”) that are very common in the field of mobile apps such that they are easy-to-understand for every possible user.</p>

In addition to that, certain icons, like the wheelchair on the profile page, have an “I” icon attached which, by clicking, shows a short description of its functionality.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The app opens on the “Home” page. From here, there are multiple ways that can be followed. The user can select one of the two special icons that represent the location of “home” and “work” or, in the case of students, “school”. These buttons lead the user to the page where they can choose to buy a ticket. After selecting their ticket, they get to the page for choosing their payment method. At this point, they get to the “Credit card” page, where can pay with a registered card, add a new credit card or delete an already existing card. After the payment, they can check their ticket by going on the “Profile Page” and clicking on “My tickets”, where they are shown a list of their active tickets.</li>
                        <li>In case the user wants to check the buses/ buy a ticket for another location, they need to click on the “search” icon, represented by the magnifying glass. They need to complete the field for “from” and “to” and select the time they want to leave/ arrive. Optionally, they may choose whether they only want to go by tram or bus and if they need wheelchair-friendly transportation devices. After pressing “search”, they are redirected to a page that shows a list of transportation devices that are suited for the requirements. Here, if the user wants to proceed to buy a ticket, they need to click on the device of their choice – this step is useful mainly to the people using wheelchairs as the ticket they buy books a special platform and space inside the device. The process of buying a ticket continues the same as above.</li>
                        <li>If the user only wants to buy general tickets, without checking the timetable of transportation devices, they need to click on the “ticket” icon and are redirected to the “Buy a ticket” page. The process of buying the ticket goes on the very same, with the only exception that now the option for “wheelchair” is not available.</li>
                        <li>When the user wants to see the timetable of trams/ buses for a specific station in the city, they can click on the “compass” icon and get redirected to the “Map” page. Here, they need to click on the station they are interested in and a pop-up timetable appears on the screen.</li>
                        <li>The fifth, and last, icon on the foot bar represents the “Profile” page. If the user is logged in, they are redirected to their profile. The first two options on this page are adding the addresses for “Home” and “Work” in order to create the shortcuts for buying tickets. Then, there is the option to “Add Student Account Info” where students need to register in order to get the reduced prices for tickets. The next icon represents a wheelchair and signifies the possibility of always being shown only the transportation devices that are suited for wheelchairs. The last two buttons redirect the user to the “My tickets” page and the “Credit card” page (both of them are described above).</li>
                        <li>In case the user is not logged in, they are redirected to a page where they can sign in by introducing their id and password. In case they don’t have an account, they may click on “Sign up”. Then, they are sent to a page where they can create a new account by choosing an id, a password and an e-mail address.</li>
                        <li>The “Settings” page gives the option of changing the language, time zone and the light/ dark theme. The user can log out of their account by pressing “Log out”. They are also given information about the legal terms, policy and open source libraries.</li>
                        <li>Still in the “Settings” page, the last line “Need Help?” redirects the user, by clicking on the work “help”, to a new page, that displays a list of possible pages that can be accessed in order to get information. By clicking on the button having as name the page they require help for, they are redirected to a new page explaining the way the need to proceed.</li>
